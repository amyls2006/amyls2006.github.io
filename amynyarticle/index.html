        POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. &ndash; One lifeguard will sit perched on a tall wooden chair. Two
        <br> 
        others, maintaining distance, will stand sentinel on the beach below.
        <p>  
        All three will wear scarf-like masks and carry face shields and respirators equipped with new
        <br> 
        HEPA filters.
        <p>
        They will patrol a beach that a town engineer determined can hold precisely 197 groups in zones
        <br> 
        roughly 18-feet square, allowing six feet of personal space in between.
        <p>
        "We're trying to make sure that we can safely open as much as possible, as quickly as possible,"
        <br> 
        said Paul M. Kanitra, the mayor of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., about 70 miles south of New
        <br> 
        York City. "And that we don't misstep too early."
